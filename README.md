# hospitalAutomation

<p> All functions are operational, but only when data is deleted from a table that is associated with another table, only the deletion is performed in the table in which the operation is performed, and the linked deletion has not yet been added in the other table. It will be added and updated later.  </p>


<p> Photos of the project will be added when the automation is completely finished. </p>
